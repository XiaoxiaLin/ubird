    "MongoDB is a document-oriented database, part of the NoSQL family of database systems. MongoDB stores structured data as JSON-like structures. From a pythonic point of view it is like storing dictionary data structures. One of its main feature is its schema-less feature, i.e. it supports dynamic schemas. A schema in a relational database informally referst to the structure of the data it stores, i.e. what kind of data, which tables, which relations, etc."
